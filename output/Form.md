# Description: What is the Open Science practice/initiative about?

*Please provide information as to the following aspects (as applicable):*

-   [*Introduction*]{.underline}*: short overview of the initiative. What are
    its key Open Science objectives (and others, if applicable)? Who are the
    target groups? What are the main activities organised?*
    
Our initiative consists of developing an open science framework that can be used across the research projects in our lab and exported to other departments, both in and outside our institution. It consists of three steps: data data management, which will be done using OPAL, part of the Obiba environment; data computing, which will follow the literate computing framework using Markdown and R Studio; and version control, which will be done using Git. EXPAND. Our key Open Science objective is to increase reproducibility and to engage the research community in our projects. Our main target group is all researchers worldwide and ultimately the entire population.

-   [*Context*]{.underline} *in which the initiative was implemented: What
    prompted you to develop this initiative?*
    
As tools like Open Science Framework (OSF) rapidly grow, world-leading funding bodies, such as Welcome Trust in the United Kingdom and the National Institute of Health in the United States of America, include compulsory open access guidelines for their research projects. More recently, the European Commission started to adhere to this initiative, and calls such as the Horizon 2020 programme for research and innovation include specific open access policies. Our lab is a World Health Organisation collaborating centre focused on mental health services research and training. We are based at the Department of Psychiatry at the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, which is or has been involved in nearly ten projects funded by the European Union. In this initiative, we used our expertise in two of these projects, namely SYNCHROS and RESPOND, with the broad aim to expand it to other projects.

With SYNCHROS we used literate computing and version Control, with RESPOND we are using the three steps.
    

-   [*Obstacles and solutions*]{.underline}*: What challenges, if any, were
    encountered? Were they/how were they solved?*

We encountered obstacles both within and outside our lab. In our lab, the main challenge was overcoming the lack of specific training in OS. We are currently doing Tidyverse sessions, we bought a server, we are trying to use Git, etc. Outside the institution, the main challenge is that other partners see this as an investment they don’t have time to make.

# Outputs: What has the initiative achieved so far?

*Please provide information as to the following aspects (as applicable):*

-   [*Benefits*]{.underline}*: What benefits were realised (to date) through
    this initiative, and for whom?*
    
SYNCRHOS insert. In RESPOND, we have already published open access manuscripts aimed at informing mental and occupational health policies for vulnerable popularions during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially HCWs. Soon, we will report the results of our RCT, and make the code available.

-   [*Lessons learnt*]{.underline}*: What knowledge have you gained (so far)
    through your work?*
    
In the context of the COVID-19 pandemics, preprints increased, journals had open access policies, etc. In a rapidly changing world, with climate crisis, wars, etc., research should (and will) move rapidly and collaboratively. This requires training and collaboration, and it is the reason why we apply for this grant.

# Reusability: What steps have been taken for others to reuse this initiative?

*Please provide information as to the following aspects (as applicable):*

-   *What are the steps you have taken/are taking to make the initiative
    available to others?*
    
Learnings from SYNCHROS and RESPOND. We have been developing SOPs (e.g., for anonymization), we are doing minutes in our meetings, we share our manuscripts in OneDrive so that we can keep track of versions, comments, etc.). We will share our server at the CCC with other research groups if they need it.

-   *Is the practice, its structure and output, easily findable online? If yes,
    where?*
    
 This I don’t understand well. Include links to policy briefs, SOPs, SYNCHROS paper, Lea’s paper on Git, etc.

-   *Can the practice be reused in other departments or institutions?*

We will share our server at the CCC with other research groups if they need it. We will train other Departments. When we lead initiatives, we will develop an OS framework to work collaboratively (something from SYNCHROS here too). There are materials already available, e.g., DataShield monthly drop-in sessions.

# Follow-up: How do you intend to use the award?

*How would this award support you / your team in taking forward your current
initiative, or would you like to initiate a new project with the financial
resources from the award?*

We will use the money for training. We will develop an SOP for the lab. We will embed new projects in this OS framework. We will try to migrate previous projects when possible. We will also try to anonymize datasets to avoid GDPR and make them publicly accessible -if not possible, we will use OPAL and DataShield.
