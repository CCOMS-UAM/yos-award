As a research group and a World Health Organization's collaborating centre, we
work daily with researchers and professionals living abroad. This requires tools
that help tracking exchanges between labs in a comprehensive way, such as
statistical code, manuscript drafts, or meeting minutes. By taking this
approach, we aims not only to develop a stronger open science practice within
our lab, but also across different research consortia in the European Union
(EU). We are currently in a test phase of implementing this open science way of
working in our research group. This may potentially spread through different
institutes in the region and improve reproducibility rates for the whole
research community. For example,in the EU-funded project RESPOND, we have
already published open-access manuscripts to inform mental and occupational
health policies for vulnerable populations during the COVID-19 pandemic,
especially HCWs. Soon, we will report the RCT results and make the code
available. This will allow researchers to have full access not only to the
results of the study but also to how the study developed.

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, preprints increased, journals had
open-access policies, etc. In a rapidly changing world, with the climate crisis,
wars, etc., research should (and will) move rapidly and collaboratively. This
requires training and collaboration, which is why we apply for this grant. One
of the main benefits of developing this practice is having a complete history
accessible to all. This increases the transparency of a study and facilitates
communication. Moreover, it is an interesting tool for the researcher himself.
Indeed, having this history allowed us to keep in writing what was done, what
worked but also what led to errors. This written trace allowed us to save time
and avoid reproducing the same mistake while understanding why. Also, when we
want to remember the previous steps and what has already been done by our peers,
it is easy to navigate within it once familiar with the platform and find this
information.

# Reusability: What steps have been taken for others to reuse this initiative?

*Please provide information as to the following aspects (as applicable):*

-   *What are the steps you have taken/are taking to make the initiative
    available to others?*

    Learnings from SYNCHROS and RESPOND. We have been developing SOPs (e.g., for
    anonymization), we are doing minutes in our meetings, we share our
    manuscripts in OneDrive so that we can keep track of versions, comments,
    etc.). We will share our server at the CCC with other research groups if
    they need it.

-   *Is the practice, its structure and output, easily findable online? If yes,
    where?*

    This I don't understand very good. Include links to policy briefs, SOPs,
    SYNCHROS paper, Lea's paper on Git, etc.

-   *Can the practice be reused in other departments or institutions?*

# Follow-up: How do you intend to use the award?

-   *How would this award support you / your team in taking forward your current
    initiative, or would you like to initiate a new project with the financial
    resources from the award?*

    We will use the money for training. We will develop an SOP for the lab. We
    will embed new projects in this OS framework. We will try to migrate
    previous projects when possible. We will also try to anonymize datasets to
    avoid GDPR and make them publicly accessible -if not possible, we will use
    OPAL and DataShield.
