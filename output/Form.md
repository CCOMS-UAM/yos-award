# Description: What is the Open Science practice/initiative about?

*Please provide information as to the following aspects (as applicable):*

-   [*Introduction*]{.underline}*: short overview of the initiative. What are
    its key Open Science objectives (and others, if applicable)? Who are the
    target groups? What are the main activities organised?*

-   [*Context*]{.underline} *in which the initiative was implemented: What
    prompted you to develop this initiative?*

-   [*Obstacles and solutions*]{.underline}*: What challenges, if any, were
    encountered? Were they/how were they solved?*

    Our initiative consists of implementing a full open science workflow that
    can be used across research projects in our team and exported to other
    groups, both in and outside our institution. The aim is not only to produce
    reproducible research outputs, but to go beyond that and make the whole
    scientific production process reproducible, including project proposals and
    research designs, materials and methods, instruments and protocols, data
    management processes, analyses, and dissemination outputs such as papers,
    book chapters, conference presentations, posters, etc. We believe this
    methodology can help document the whole research process, thus helping
    resolve some issues related with scientific reproducibility: uncovering
    researchers' biases or implicit conflicts of interest, improving
    accountability, and allowing better audits. Once our methodology is refined,
    we expect to be able to disseminate it to other groups, so our target
    audience would ultimately be the scientific community as a whole.

    It consists of three steps: data data management, which will be done using
    OPAL, part of the Obiba environment; data computing, which will follow the
    literate computing framework using Markdown and R Studio; and version
    control, which will be done using Git. EXPAND. Our key Open Science
    objective is to increase reproducibility and to engage the research
    community in our projects. Our main target group is all researchers
    worldwide and ultimately the entire population.

    As tools like Open Science Framework (OSF) rapidly grow, world-leading
    funding bodies, such as Welcome Trust in the United Kingdom and the National
    Institute of Health in the United States of America, include compulsory open
    access guidelines for their research projects. More recently, the European
    Commission started to adhere to this initiative, and calls such as the
    Horizon 2020 programme for research and innovation include specific open
    access policies. Our lab is a World Health Organisation collaborating centre
    focused on mental health services research and training. We are based at the
    Department of Psychiatry at the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid, which is or
    has been involved in nearly ten projects funded by the European Union. In
    this initiative, we used our expertise in two of these projects, namely
    SYNCHROS and RESPOND, with the broad aim to expand it to other projects.

    With SYNCHROS we used literate computing and version Control, with RESPOND
    we are using the three steps.

    We encountered obstacles both within and outside our lab. In our lab, the
    main challenge was overcoming the lack of specific training in OS. We are
    currently doing Tidyverse sessions, we bought a server, we are trying to use
    Git, etc. Outside the institution, the main challenge is that other partners
    see this as an investment they don't have time to make.

# Outputs: What has the initiative achieved so far?

*Please provide information as to the following aspects (as applicable):*

-   [*Benefits*]{.underline}*: What benefits were realised (to date) through
    this initiative, and for whom?*

    SYNCRHOS insert. In RESPOND, we have already published open access
    manuscripts aimed at informing mental and occupational health policies for
    vulnerable popularions during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially HCWs. Soon,
    we will report the results of our RCT, and make the code available.

-   [*Lessons learnt*]{.underline}*: What knowledge have you gained (so far)
    through your work?*

    In the context of the COVID-19 pandemics, preprints increased, journals had
    open access policies, etc. In a rapidly changing world, with climate crisis,
    wars, etc., research should (and will) move rapidly and collaboratively.
    This requires training and collaboration, and it is the reason why we apply
    for this grant.

# Reusability: What steps have been taken for others to reuse this initiative?

*Please provide information as to the following aspects (as applicable):*

-   *What are the steps you have taken/are taking to make the initiative
    available to others?*

    Learnings from SYNCHROS and RESPOND. We have been developing SOPs (e.g., for
    anonymization), we are doing minutes in our meetings, we share our
    manuscripts in OneDrive so that we can keep track of versions, comments,
    etc.). We will share our server at the CCC with other research groups if
    they need it.

-   *Is the practice, its structure and output, easily findable online? If yes,
    where?*

    This I don't understand very good. Include links to policy briefs, SOPs,
    SYNCHROS paper, Lea's paper on Git, etc.

-   *Can the practice be reused in other departments or institutions?*

# Follow-up: How do you intend to use the award?

-   *How would this award support you / your team in taking forward your current
    initiative, or would you like to initiate a new project with the financial
    resources from the award?*

    We will use the money for training. We will develop an SOP for the lab. We
    will embed new projects in this OS framework. We will try to migrate
    previous projects when possible. We will also try to anonymize datasets to
    avoid GDPR and make them publicly accessible -if not possible, we will use
    OPAL and DataShield.
