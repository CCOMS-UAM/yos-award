# Description: What is the Open Science practice/initiative about?

*Please provide information as to the following aspects (as applicable):*

-   [*Introduction*]{.underline}*: short overview of the initiative. What are
    its key Open Science objectives (and others, if applicable)? Who are the
    target groups? What are the main activities organised?*

-   [*Context*]{.underline} *in which the initiative was implemented: What
    prompted you to develop this initiative?*

-   [*Obstacles and solutions*]{.underline}*: What challenges, if any, were
    encountered? Were they/how were they solved?*

The European Commission has started to adhere to open access guidelines. Our
group is or has been involved in nearly ten international projects funded by the
European Union. We have developed our methodology for reproducibility in two
recent projects, with the aim of standardizing it, and disseminate it to other
groups. Therefore, our target audience will ultimately be the whole scientific
community.

Our proposal consists of implementing a full open science workflow, reusable
across research projects and exportable to other groups. The aim is not only to
produce reproducible research outputs, but to make the whole scientific
production process reproducible: We want to make the historical of the
scientific process itself completely transparent and reproducible by documenting
all the progress and decisions made along the way. We implement this using three
technologies: open data management, literate computing, and version control.
Open data management is implemented by means of the Opal technology (a
Linux-based server), which enables data sharing with a controlled interface
without disclosing sensitive, personal data. Literate computing is implemented
with the Rstudio environment and associated components ("de facto" standards
such as the Rmarkdown format and the Knitr engine). It allows editing all
research outputs in text format, combining data analyses and natural language to
produce e.g. manuscripts. Version control is implemented via Git (and Github
service) by using text files exclusively.

Although these technologies made it possible to manage projects in a completely
reproducible way, some challenges still remain. First, both Opal and Git require
a high level of expertise. Consequently, we often consult with experts in other
fields or investigate our own solutions, and we are currently implementing
training sessions on literate computing ecosystem and version control
management. Second, the literate computing framework does not ensure full
automation, and requires both evaluating the level of automation and documenting
the manual steps required for reproducing the output (if not automated) -in a
previous work, we managed to achieve 99% of automation, with only four minor
steps performed manually before submitting a manuscript to a scientific journal.
Last, many researchers are reluctant to adopt these technologies. When this
happens, we adapt our workflows to the needs of the other researchers involved,
while putting formative actions in place to help bridge that resistance gap.

# Outputs: What has the initiative achieved so far?

*Please provide information as to the following aspects (as applicable):*

-   [*Benefits*]{.underline}*: What benefits were realised (to date) through
    this initiative, and for whom?*

    SYNCRHOS insert. In RESPOND, we have already published open access
    manuscripts aimed at informing mental and occupational health policies for
    vulnerable popularions during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially HCWs. Soon,
    we will report the results of our RCT, and make the code available.

-   [*Lessons learnt*]{.underline}*: What knowledge have you gained (so far)
    through your work?*

    In the context of the COVID-19 pandemics, preprints increased, journals had
    open access policies, etc. In a rapidly changing world, with climate crisis,
    wars, etc., research should (and will) move rapidly and collaboratively.
    This requires training and collaboration, and it is the reason why we apply
    for this grant.

# Reusability: What steps have been taken for others to reuse this initiative?

*Please provide information as to the following aspects (as applicable):*

-   *What are the steps you have taken/are taking to make the initiative
    available to others?*

    Learnings from SYNCHROS and RESPOND. We have been developing SOPs (e.g., for
    anonymization), we are doing minutes in our meetings, we share our
    manuscripts in OneDrive so that we can keep track of versions, comments,
    etc.). We will share our server at the CCC with other research groups if
    they need it.

-   *Is the practice, its structure and output, easily findable online? If yes,
    where?*

    This I don't understand very good. Include links to policy briefs, SOPs,
    SYNCHROS paper, Lea's paper on Git, etc.

-   *Can the practice be reused in other departments or institutions?*

# Follow-up: How do you intend to use the award?

-   *How would this award support you / your team in taking forward your current
    initiative, or would you like to initiate a new project with the financial
    resources from the award?*

    We will use the money for training. We will develop an SOP for the lab. We
    will embed new projects in this OS framework. We will try to migrate
    previous projects when possible. We will also try to anonymize datasets to
    avoid GDPR and make them publicly accessible -if not possible, we will use
    OPAL and DataShield.
