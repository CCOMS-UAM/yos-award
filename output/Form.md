# Description: What is the Open Science practice/initiative about?

*Please provide information as to the following aspects (as applicable):*

-   [*Introduction*]{.underline}*: short overview of the initiative. What are
    its key Open Science objectives (and others, if applicable)? Who are the
    target groups? What are the main activities organised?*

    Our initiative consists of developing an open science framework that can be
    used across the research projects in our lab and exported to other
    departments, both in and outside our institution. It consists of three
    steps: data data management, which will be done using OPAL, part of the
    Obiba environment; data computing, which will follow the literate computing
    framework using Markdown and R Studio; and version control, which will be
    done using Git. EXPAND. Our key Open Science objective is to increase
    reproducibility and to engage the research community in our projects. Our
    main target group is all researchers worldwide and ultimately the entire
    population.

-   [*Context*]{.underline} *in which the initiative was implemented: What
    prompted you to develop this initiative?*

    As tools like Open Science Framework (OSF) rapidly grow, world-leading
    funding bodies, such as Welcome Trust in the United Kingdom and the National
    Institute of Health in the United States of America, include compulsory open
    access guidelines for their research projects. More recently, the European
    Commission started to adhere to this initiative, and calls such as the
    Horizon 2020 programme for research and innovation include specific open
    access policies. Our lab is a World Health Organisation collaborating centre
    focused on mental health services research and training. We are based at the
    Department of Psychiatry at the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, which is or
    has been involved in nearly ten projects funded by the European Union. In
    this initiative, we used our expertise in two of these projects, namely
    SYNCHROS and RESPOND, with the broad aim to expand it to other projects.

    With SYNCHROS we used literate computing and version Control, with RESPOND
    we are using the three steps.

-   [*Obstacles and solutions*]{.underline}*: What challenges, if any, were
    encountered? Were they/how were they solved?*

    We encountered obstacles both within and outside our lab. In our lab, the
    main challenge was overcoming the lack of specific training in OS. We are
    currently doing Tidyverse sessions, we bought a server, we are trying to use
    Git, etc. Outside the institution, the main challenge is that other partners
    see this as an investment they don't have time to make.

# Outputs: What has the initiative achieved so far?

*Please provide information as to the following aspects (as applicable):*

-   [*Benefits*]{.underline}*: What benefits were realised (to date) through
    this initiative, and for whom?*

    SYNCRHOS insert. In RESPOND, we have already published open access
    manuscripts aimed at informing mental and occupational health policies for
    vulnerable popularions during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially HCWs. Soon,
    we will report the results of our RCT, and make the code available.

-   [*Lessons learnt*]{.underline}*: What knowledge have you gained (so far)
    through your work?*

    In the context of the COVID-19 pandemics, preprints increased, journals had
    open access policies, etc. In a rapidly changing world, with climate crisis,
    wars, etc., research should (and will) move rapidly and collaboratively.
    This requires training and collaboration, and it is the reason why we apply
    for this grant.

# Reusability: What steps have been taken for others to reuse this initiative?

*Please provide information as to the following aspects (as applicable):*

-   *What are the steps you have taken/are taking to make the initiative
    available to others?*

    Learnings from SYNCHROS and RESPOND. We have been developing SOPs (e.g., for
    anonymization), we are doing minutes in our meetings, we share our
    manuscripts in OneDrive so that we can keep track of versions, comments,
    etc.). We will share our server at the CCC with other research groups if
    they need it.

-   *Is the practice, its structure and output, easily findable online? If yes,
    where?*

    This I don't understand very good. Include links to policy briefs, SOPs,
    SYNCHROS paper, Lea's paper on Git, etc.

-   *Can the practice be reused in other departments or institutions?*

We will record all the steps taken so that anyone can use and/or adapt them,
regardless of their level of expertise We are currently training people in our
lab on tools that potentially increase transparency and overall compliance with
open science requirements in relation to our scientific production. These are
some examples:

-   We developed a template for R Studio projects that is used across different
    repositories (https://github.com/DaniMori/rproj-template).
-   We use version control provided by GitHub.
-   We use remote servers, including one hosted by the Scientific Computation
    Centre at the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid.
-   We use the free, open-source software Opal to host our datasets.
-   We use the free, open-source software DataShield to perform federated.
    analyses of multiple datasets while keeping sensitive data securely stored
    at each institution.

In this way, each member of the group knows how to implement changes to
manuscript versions and programming code, and where to look for track records of
changes, so that everything could be accounted for. We get this experience from
two projects, namely RESPOND (https://respond-project.eu/es/) and SYNCHROS
(https://synchros.eu/), and we try to use it at all research stages (e.g.,
from meetings' minutes to manuscript writing). Our latest project is this
application, which is currently being prepared on RStudio and Github and tries
to be as compliant as possible with the Open Science framework (see here:
https://github.com/CCOMS-UAM/yos-award).

Our knowledge and expertise may already help other research groups. We will
provie support by sharing the server, training other departments, or taking the
lead on initiatives to develop an enhanced open science framework for
collaborative work. There are already materials that can be provided for this
purpose (e.g., DataShield monthly drop-in sessions:
https://data2knowledge.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DSDEV/overview and
https://www.youtube.com/@datashield5702/videos).

# Follow-up: How do you intend to use the award?

-   *How would this award support you / your team in taking forward your current
    initiative, or would you like to initiate a new project with the financial
    resources from the award?*

    Our aim is to embed all our scientific production within this workflow,
    leveraging as much as possible on open science practices from beginning to
    end. In order to this, we want to dig further into our understanding and
    know-how of data access management with Opal (and the Obiba suite in
    general), literate computing, and version control with git/GitHub. All these
    technologies enable creating reliable reproducible workflows, but learning
    to naviagte them is time- and effort-consuming; we need to draw our
    knowledge from the field of software engineering and computer science, and
    then adapt it and translate it to the needs and particularities of
    scientific production.

    At the present time, our self assessment is that we are in a maturing phase
    of our skill-development process with these technologies. Before we are able
    to expand our best practices outside our own group, we need to consolidate
    our knowledge. Consequently, we believe that we need to take courses and
    training activities.

    Therefore, we would allocate the prize for training in the use of these
    technologies. We would like to develop an expertise that can then be
    translated into formative actions that can be exported to the rest of the
    research communities. Thus, we believe the prize may be a great opportunity
    to invest in this first stage of specific, mid- to high-level training. This
    would be the first step towards taking a borader action that can be spread
    throughout the scientific community.
