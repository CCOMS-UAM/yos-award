    its key Open Science objectives (and others, if applicable)? Who are the
    target groups? What are the main activities organised?*
-   [*Context*]{.underline} *in which the initiative was implemented: What
    prompted you to develop this initiative?*
-   [*Obstacles and solutions*]{.underline}*: What challenges, if any, were
    encountered? Were they/how were they solved?*

# Reusability: What steps have been taken for others to reuse this initiative?

*Please provide information as to the following aspects (as applicable):*

-   *What are the steps you have taken/are taking to make the initiative
    available to others?*

-   *Is the practice, its structure and output, easily findable online? If yes,
    where?*

-   *Can the practice be reused in other departments or institutions?*

The idea is to record all the steps that are taken so that they are accessible
and reusable by everyone, regardless of their level of experience with the
technology. Thus, in our research group we are training each of the members in
the use of tools that allow us to be more transparent and compliant with open
science requirements in relation to our scientific production through seminars,
such as:

*The creation of projects in RStudio with a template that can be modified for
each study we are involved.* The use of version control provided by GitHub. *The
use of remote servers (e.g., CCC)* The use of other programming frameworks such
as Opal to perform statistical analysis in a federated manner, so that the
research process increases its transparency while eliminating the possibility of
sensitive information that identifies individuals coming to light when the data
is aggregated.

In this way, each member of the group knows how to implement changes to
manuscript versions and programming code, and where to look for track records of
changes, so that everything could be accounted for. We get this experience from
two projects that are either ongoing or already completed,
[RESPOND](https://respond-project.eu/es/) and [SYNCHROS](https://synchros.eu/).
It is not only about recording the scientific production, but also the process
of getting to it (i.e., recording minutes of meetings).

We are currently using GitHub for participanting in different research projects
in hidden mode. GitHub is also being used for the proposal design for the (Yerun
Open Science Award)[<https://github.com/CCOMS-UAM/yos-award>]. The aim is to be
able to generate enough documentation to make public and more accessible the
management of this kind of applications.

All the knowledge we have gained should be used as a guide for other research
groups and we will facilitate this if possible by sharing the server, training
other departments or leading initiatives that allow us to develop an open
science framework to work collaboratively. There are already materials that can
be provided for this purpose (e.g., DataShield monthly drop-in sessions).

# Follow-up: How do you intend to use the award?

*How would this award support you / your team in taking forward your current
initiative, or would you like to initiate a new project with the financial
resources from the award?*
