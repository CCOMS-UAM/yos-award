# Reusability: What steps have been taken for others to reuse this initiative?

*Please provide information as to the following aspects (as applicable):*

-   *What are the steps you have taken/are taking to make the initiative
    available to others?*

-   *Is the practice, its structure and output, easily findable online? If yes,
    where?*

-   *Can the practice be reused in other departments or institutions?*

We will record all the steps taken so that anyone can use and/or adapt them,
regardless of their level of expertise We are currently training people in our
lab on tools that potentially increase transparency and overall compliance with
open science requirements in relation to our scientific production. These are
some examples:

-   We developed a template for R Studio projects that is used across different
    repositories <https://github.com/DaniMori/rproj-template>.
-   We use version control provided by GitHub.
-   We use remote servers, including one hosted by the Scientific Computation 
    Centre at the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid.
-   We use the free, open-source software Opal to host our datasets.
-   We use the free, open-source software DataShield to perform federated.
    analyses of multiple datasets while keeping sensitive data securely stored
    at each institution.

In this way, each member of the group knows how to implement changes to
manuscript versions and programming code, and where to look for track records of
changes, so that everything could be accounted for. We get this experience from
two projects, namely RESPOND (https://respond-project.eu/es/) and
SYNCHROS (https://synchros.eu/), and we try to use it at all research stages
(e.g., from meetings' minutes to manuscript writing). Our latest project is this
application, which is currently being prepared on RStudio and Github and tries
to be as compliant as possible with the Open Science framework (see
here: https://github.com/CCOMS-UAM/yos-award).

Our knowledge and expertise may already help other research groups. We will
provie support by sharing the server, training other departments, or taking the
lead on initiatives to develop an enhanced open science framework for
collaborative work. There are already materials that can be provided for this
purpose (e.g., DataShield monthly drop-in sessions: 
https://data2knowledge.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DSDEV/overview and
https://www.youtube.com/@datashield5702/videos).

# Follow-up: How do you intend to use the award?

*How would this award support you / your team in taking forward your current
initiative, or would you like to initiate a new project with the financial
resources from the award?*
