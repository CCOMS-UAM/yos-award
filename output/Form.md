# Description: What is the Open Science practice/initiative about?

*Please provide information as to the following aspects (as applicable):*

-   [*Introduction*]{.underline}*: short overview of the initiative. What are
    its key Open Science objectives (and others, if applicable)? Who are the
    target groups? What are the main activities organised?*

    Our initiative consists of developing an open science framework that can be
    used across the research projects in our lab and exported to other
    departments, both in and outside our institution. It consists of three
    steps: data data management, which will be done using OPAL, part of the
    Obiba environment; data computing, which will follow the literate computing
    framework using Markdown and R Studio; and version control, which will be
    done using Git. EXPAND. Our key Open Science objective is to increase
    reproducibility and to engage the research community in our projects. Our
    main target group is all researchers worldwide and ultimately the entire
    population.

-   [*Context*]{.underline} *in which the initiative was implemented: What
    prompted you to develop this initiative?*

    As tools like Open Science Framework (OSF) rapidly grow, world-leading
    funding bodies, such as Welcome Trust in the United Kingdom and the National
    Institute of Health in the United States of America, include compulsory open
    access guidelines for their research projects. More recently, the European
    Commission started to adhere to this initiative, and calls such as the
    Horizon 2020 programme for research and innovation include specific open
    access policies. Our lab is a World Health Organisation collaborating centre
    focused on mental health services research and training. We are based at the
    Department of Psychiatry at the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid, which is or
    has been involved in nearly ten projects funded by the European Union. In
    this initiative, we used our expertise in two of these projects, namely
    SYNCHROS and RESPOND, with the broad aim to expand it to other projects.

    With SYNCHROS we used literate computing and version Control, with RESPOND
    we are using the three steps.

-   [*Obstacles and solutions*]{.underline}*: What challenges, if any, were
    encountered? Were they/how were they solved?*

    We encountered obstacles both within and outside our lab. In our lab, the
    main challenge was overcoming the lack of specific training in OS. We are
    currently doing Tidyverse sessions, we bought a server, we are trying to use
    Git, etc. Outside the institution, the main challenge is that other partners
    see this as an investment they don't have time to make.

# Outputs: What has the initiative achieved so far?

*Please provide information as to the following aspects (as applicable):*

-   [*Benefits*]{.underline}*: What benefits were realised (to date) through
    this initiative, and for whom?*

    Within the different projects related to the research group, we work daily
    with researchers and professionals living abroad. This need for
    international synchronization has given rise to a considerable need to use a
    tool capable of tracking exchanges between researchers more comprehensively.
    Having a history of changes and different proposals established is not only
    useful within our group but also for the whole scientific community. Indeed,
    reproducibility is nowadays one of the major points of research. Giving the
    researcher a detailed path of what has been done in a study brings
    transparency and fidelity. As a concrete example, in the "RESPONDproject",
    we have already published open-access manuscripts to inform mental and
    occupational health policies for vulnerable populations during the COVID-19
    pandemic, especially HCWs. Soon, we will report the RCT results and make the
    code available. This will allow researchers to have full access not only to
    the results of the study but also to how the study developed.

-   [*Lessons learnt*]{.underline}*: What knowledge have you gained (so far)
    through your work?*

    In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, preprints increased, journals had
    open-access policies, etc. In a rapidly changing world, with the climate
    crisis, wars, etc., research should (and will) move rapidly and
    collaboratively. This requires training and collaboration, which is why we
    apply for this grant. One of the main benefits of developing this practice
    is having a complete history accessible to all. This increases the
    transparency of a study and facilitates communication. Moreover, it is an
    interesting tool for the researcher himself. Indeed, having this history
    allowed us to keep in writing what was done, what worked but also what led
    to an error. This written trace allowed us to save time and avoid
    reproducing the same mistake while understanding why. Also, when we want to
    remember the previous steps and what has already been done by our peers, it
    is easy to navigate within it once familiar with the platform and find this
    information.

# Reusability: What steps have been taken for others to reuse this initiative?

*Please provide information as to the following aspects (as applicable):*

-   *What are the steps you have taken/are taking to make the initiative
    available to others?*

    Learnings from SYNCHROS and RESPOND. We have been developing SOPs (e.g., for
    anonymization), we are doing minutes in our meetings, we share our
    manuscripts in OneDrive so that we can keep track of versions, comments,
    etc.). We will share our server at the CCC with other research groups if
    they need it.

-   *Is the practice, its structure and output, easily findable online? If yes,
    where?*

    This I don't understand very good. Include links to policy briefs, SOPs,
    SYNCHROS paper, Lea's paper on Git, etc.

-   *Can the practice be reused in other departments or institutions?*

# Follow-up: How do you intend to use the award?

-   *How would this award support you / your team in taking forward your current
    initiative, or would you like to initiate a new project with the financial
    resources from the award?*

    We will use the money for training. We will develop an SOP for the lab. We
    will embed new projects in this OS framework. We will try to migrate
    previous projects when possible. We will also try to anonymize datasets to
    avoid GDPR and make them publicly accessible -if not possible, we will use
    OPAL and DataShield.
