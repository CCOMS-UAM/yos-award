# Action points

## Approval of minutes from 30/11/2022 meeting

#### Agreements

-   **Postponed**: Approve of the previous minutes.

## Use of 'sourcetree' for manipulating branches on Git

#### Debate

-   We discuss how version history is recorded and who is changing what.
-   A good tool to manage branches is 'sourcetree', which can be easily
    downloaded from [here](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/).

## Use of canonical mode

#### Debate

-   Canonical mode saves us conflicts when working with people who prefer to
    work with different modes (Source or Visual).
-   It establishes conventions that are always applied in Visual to Source mode.

## Skeleton of the proposal

#### Debate

-   Based on three key concepts:

    -   data management

    -   [literate
        computing](https://medium.com/@mryap/what-is-literate-computing-6b3de57595a6)

    -   version control

#### Agreements

-   **Approved**: Proposal fill-in

-   **Approved**: Bifurcate branch `drafting/template-fillin` to fill in the
    corresponding section; e.g., `drafting/reusability` to fill in section
    "Reusability"

#### Tasks
