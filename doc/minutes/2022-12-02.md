# Action points

## Approval of the previous minutes

We left pending for the next meeting to approve the minutes of the first meeting
taken by Jesus due to github usability issues.

## Use of 'sourcetree' for manipulating branches on Git

We discuss how version history is recorded and who is changing what. A good tool
to manage branches is 'sourcetree', which can be easily downloaded from
[here](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/).

## Use of canonical mode

The use of the canonical mode saves us conflicts when working with people who
prefer to work with different modes (Source or Visual). This is because it
establishes conventions that are always applied in Visual to Source mode. In our
project it is set up to get as few headaches as possible in this matter.

## Skeleton of the proposal

After discussing different usability problems with Git and solving the issue of
the branches to work on, Roberto presents us how he has structured the skeleton
of the proposal. In this sense, it has been based on three key concepts:

-   data management
-   [literate
    computing](https://medium.com/@mryap/what-is-literate-computing-6b3de57595a6)
-   version control It is decided that each of the four will review a part of
    the skeleton and elaborate it in maximum 400 characters, and that Roberto
    will be the one to finally review it as a whole.
